Welcome, this program determines the last survivor in a game Josephus, where n people stand in a circle and
every k-th person is eliminated until only one person survives.
In the command line please enter the optional -v, number of rebels, and the increment in which rebels are killed.
Enter -v if you would like to display when a person commits suicide and the rebels remaining, otherwise only
 the survivor will be displayed.
